# Portfolio 💼

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Or, as I like to call it, "the hub of all things me." This is where you can get to know me, my experience, the skills I bring to the table.

## What’s Inside? 📂

- **About Me** 🕶️  
   Discover a bit about my journey, my skills, and probably more about my coffee addiction than you asked for.

- **Experience** 💻  
   I’ve done some things, in some places, with some people. Check out the highlights of my career so far.

- **Contact** 📫  
   Feel free to reach out if you think we’d make a good team, or if you just want to send me funny memes. Both are equally appreciated.

## Why This Repo Exists 🤷‍♂️

Because everyone needs a digital “hey, look at me!” moment, right? Also, because GitHub is a lot better than keeping all my info on a crumpled resume. Plus, it’s open-source, so if you find a typo, you get to feel like a hero by fixing it.
